# Project Title
To analyse and identify Discrepancies in Compensation and Benefits for Employees working in various government organisations in the city of San Francisco, California.

# Agenda
- The study aims to investigate the variations in salaries, benefits, and total compensation among different job positions, unions, and job families within the departments of these organisations.
- The analysis will focus on understanding the factors contributing to these discrepancies, such as overtime, other benefits, and union affiliations, with the goal of ensuring fair and equitable compensation for all employees.

Business Context:
- Equity and Fairness in Compensation: The primary goal is to ensure that compensation (including salaries and benefits) is fair and equitable across different job positions, departments, and union affiliations within the city's government organizations.
- Understanding Influencing Factors: To analyse how factors like overtime, other benefits, and union memberships contribute to variations in total compensation
